# Chessy
This is an under consturction chess framework. It aims to be fully customizable as you can change rules, manipulate the chess pieces and much more.

Anyway this is a challenge for me to interact with OOP, frameworks and languages.

## What is this framework consists of?
This framework would be customizable and modular as possible.

**Chessy Project will consist of 3 main parts:**
- Render Engine
- Logic Engine
- AI Engine

### The Render Engine
This is the part that shows the game on screen whether it is in Windows Forms, WPF, Java, Python GUIs or maybe a 3D enviroment. All of the is the Render Engine task.

### The Logic Engine
This is the place where you will define the rules, check if the play is valid or invalid, show you the possible moves and so on. Its main challenge though would be when playing with the game rules.

### The AI Engine
Seems easy, doesn't it? With a lot of rules you can change I really don't think that this would be an easy challenge. But I think I should give it a try.

## Why all that?
For me I want to build this as a challenge. In the same time I believe that it would be a great idea too. I am planning to port the code I will write to every language or tech I want to learn. Beginning with C#. 

Also you are welcome to contribute too 😊.
It would be awesome to give me feedback as I really need to work in a team so feedback or contribution is a thing I really want right now. So, don't hesitate. PLEASE
